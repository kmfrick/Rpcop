# Principal Curves on Oriented Points

The files in this repository provided an implementation of principal curves on oriented points that can be compiled on modern systems.

The original implementation, of which this repository is a very simple evolution, is provided [here](https://www-eio.upc.es/~delicado/PCOP/index.html) by the authors.

Principal curves on oriented points are introduced in Delicado and Huerta ([2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001800300145)).
