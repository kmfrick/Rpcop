# Principal Curves of Oriented Points

This repository provides an implementation of principal curves on oriented points that can be compiled on modern systems, using Rcpp.

The original implementation, of which this repository is an adaptation, is provided [here](https://www-eio.upc.es/~delicado/PCOP/index.html) by the authors.

Principal curves on oriented points are introduced in Delicado and Huerta ([2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001800300145)).
