Description: Principal curves generalize the notion of a first principal component to the case in which it is a non linear smooth curve. This package provides a function pcop(X) to compute principal curves with the algorithm defined in Delicado (2001) <doi:10.1006/jmva.2000.1917> from a data matrix X.
